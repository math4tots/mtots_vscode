# mtots README

VSCode support for the mtots language.

## Features

Right now, there's only basic syntax highlighting support.
I'd like to get around to writing a full language server at some point,
but it's not high-pri for me right now.

Many of the basic rules use https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/rust/syntaxes/rust.tmLanguage.json
